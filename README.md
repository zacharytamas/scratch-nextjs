# scratch-nextjs

This repository is just a quick starting point for my experiments with various React things: basically just a quick way to get up and running with a compileable React project with Jest testing already setup, NextJs if I need SSR, etc.

## Using

(these are pretty generic and standard)

### Starting Next.js in development

```shell
$ yarn dev
```

### Running tests

```shell
$ yarn test
```
